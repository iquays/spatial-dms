# 🗺️ Spatial Data Management System

This web application is designed to manage and visualize spatial data through an intuitive interface. Users can upload spatial files in **SHP (shapefile)** format, which are then processed and displayed interactively on a map using **Leaflet.js**. The system is ideal for organizations or researchers who need to store, manage, and present geospatial data on the web.

Built with the **Yii2 PHP framework**, **Leaflet.js** for map visualization, and **MySQL** for data storage, this project provides a robust and user-friendly platform for spatial data handling.
